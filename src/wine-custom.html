        <p>Wine labels provide useful information to assist in the selection and appreciation of wine. Different countries have
          different standards for what information is required on a wine label. In the United States, wine labels are regulated
          by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department (often referred to as the TTB).
          Some states such as California have adopted supplemental labeling laws. Napa Valley wineries have historically
          provided more information than the minimum amount required by law.

        <p>This infographic and guide will help you understand a wine label like a pro, so you can buy with confidence.</p>

      <wine-label-part id="brand" part="Brand Name" ul="56,48" size="234,50">
        <p>Mandatory. If no brand name is on the label, the bottler's name is considered the brand. It is also useful to refer
          to the bottler's name if a winery has several brands.</p>
      </wine-label-part>

      <wine-label-part id="type" part="Wine Type" ul="50,303" size="250,23">
        <p>Mandatory. A wine may be labeled by a grape or varietal name such as Chardonnay or Cabernet Sauvignon, or it may
          be given a generic name such as “Red Table Wine.” Wines using varietal names must derive at least 75% of their
          volume from the grape designated, and the varietal name must appear on the label with an appellation of origin.
          Although not required, many wineries voluntarily list the proportions of the grape varieties that comprise their
          wine blends.</p>
      </wine-label-part>

      <wine-label-part id="vineyard" part="Vineyard Designation" ul="81,366" size="179,20">
        <p>Optional. Many wineries name the vineyard where the grapes were grown because the winery believes the property produces
          an unusually high-quality grape. The winery or an independent grower may own the vineyard. When using a vineyard
          designation on a wine label, federal regulations require that 95% of the grapes be grown in the named vineyard.</p>
