      <h1>Wine Label Application Tester</h1>
      <p>This application shows an example of using the wine-label element.  It used in two ways.  The first method gives a standard TTB wine label.  This allows users to install a single element that delivers a standard label desciription tool</p>

      <p>The second shows a custom wine-label with entries specific to that label.  In this case the user includes their own image, and label parts with locations.  This allows general customization of the wine label.</p>

      <p>For mobile devices, you should be able to attach this application to your home screen.</p>
