<wine-label-part id="overview" part="WINE LABELING REGULATIONS">
<p>As consumers become more adventuresome in their wine selections, they look to the label for more information.
  What makes one wine different from another?  What is the dominant grape in the wine? Where are those grapes grown? 
  Although TTB consumer protection regulations only apply to wine of at least seven percent alcohol by volume, 
  this pamphlet contains enough basic information to assist the consumer in making an informed choice when buying 
  wine This pamphlet discusses wine made from grapes, although wine may also be made from other types of fruit 
  and agricultural products.  TTB regulations can be quite detailed in regard to the production of a wine and 
  the information appearing on the bottle; not every possibility is presented here, but this guide will give 
  you a good grasp of the fundamentals.</p>
</wine-label-part>

<wine-label-part id="brand-name" part="BRAND NAME" ul="46,18" size="227,62">
<p>The brand name is used to identify and market a wine. A brand
name may not mislead the consumer about the age, identity, origin,
or other characteristics of the wine.</p>
</wine-label-part>

<wine-label-part id="vintage-date" part="VINTAGE DATE" ul="145,313" size="34,13">
<p>A vintage date on the label indicates the year in which the grapes
were harvested. If a vintage date is shown on the label at all, an
appellation of origin smaller than a country must also be shown. If an
American or imported wine uses a State or county, or the foreign
equivalent, as an appellation of origin, 85 percent of the grapes must
be from that year; if a viticultural area or the foreign equivalent is
used, the percentage is raised to 95 percent.</p>
</wine-label-part>

<wine-label-part id="varietals" part="VARIETAL DESIGNATIONS" ul="96,350" size="128,12">
<p>Varietal designations are the names of the dominant grapes used in
the wine. Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Zinfandel, and Merlot
are examples of grape varieties. A varietal designation on the label
requires an appellation of origin and means that at least 75 percent of
the grapes used to make the wine are of that variety, and that the
entire 75 percent were grown in the labeled appellation (except "Vitis
labrusca"grapes, such as Concord, which require at least
51 percent).</p>
</wine-label-part>

<wine-label-part id="estate-bottled" part="ESTATE BOTTLED" ul="113,326" size="96,12">
<p>“Estate Bottled” means that 100 percent of the wine came from
grapes grown on land owned or controlled by the winery, which must
be located in a viticultural area. The winery must crush and ferment
the grapes and finish, age, and bottle the wine in a continuous
process on their premises. The winery and the vineyard must be in
the same viticultural area.</p>
</wine-label-part>

<wine-label-part id="other" part="OTHER DESIGNATIONS" ul="113,326" size="96,12">
<p>Wine labels are not required to bear a varietal designation. Other
designations may be used to identify the wine, such as Red Wine,
Rose Wine, White Wine, Table Wine (if no more than 14% alcohol by
volume) or Dessert Wine (if over 14% alcohol by volume).</p>
<p>Some imported wines are designated with a distinctive name which is
permissible only on specific wines from a particular place or region
within the country of origin, for example, Asti Spumanti from Italy and
Bordeaux from France.</p>
</wine-label-part>

<wine-label-part id="origin" part="APPELLATION OF ORIGIN" ul="125,337" size="72,12">
<p>Appellation of origin is another name for the place in which the
dominant grapes used in the wine were grown. It can be the name of
a country, State, county or geographic region called a viticultural
area, or their foreign equivalents.</p>
<p>A country, State, or county appellation or their foreign equivalent
on the label means that at least 75 percent of the wine is produced
from grapes grown in the place named.</p>
<!--</wine-label-part>-->

<!--<wine-label-part id="area" part="VITICULTURAL AREA" ul="125,337" size="72,12">-->
<H1>VITICULTURAL AREA</H1>
<p>An American viticultural area is a defined grape-growing region in the
U.S. with geographic features (such as soil and climate) that set it
apart from the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>A viticultural area appellation on the label indicates that 85 percent or
more of the wine was produced from grapes grown in the named
area.</p>
</wine-label-part>

<wine-label-part id="alcohol" part="ALCOHOL CONTENT" ul="37,399" size="69,14">
<p>A statement of alcohol content in percent by volume appears on most
labels. As an alternative, some bottlers may label wine with an
alcohol content from 7 to 14 percent as "Table Wine"or "Light Wine."</p>
</wine-label-part>

<wine-label-part label-warning part="HEALTH WARNING STATEMENT" ul="16,426" size="290,87">
<p>By law, this statement is required on all alcohol beverages containing
0.5 percent or more alcohol by volume.</p>

<p><b>GOVERNMENT WARNING</b> (1) ACCORDING TO THE SURGEON GENERAL, WOMEN SHOULD NOT DRINK
ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES DURING PREGNANCY BECAUSE OF THE RISK OF BIRTH DEFECTS. 
(2) CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES IMPAIRS YOUR ABILITY TO DRIVE A CAR OR OPERATE

</wine-label-part>

<wine-label-part id="sulfites" part="DECLARATION OF SULFITES" ul="113,525" size="92,12">
<p>Required on any wine intended for interstate commerce that contains
10 or more parts per million of sulfur dioxide. Not required for wines
only sold in intrastate commerce.</p>
</wine-label-part>

<wine-label-part id="address" part="NAME AND ADDRESS" ul="36,375" size="251,13">
<p>The name and address of the bottler or importer must appear on the
container. It is also permissible for a bottler/importer to use a duly
authorized trade name in place of its usual operating name.</p>
<p>Domestic wines may have this statement further qualified with terms
such as “Produced,” meaning that not less than 75 percent of the
wine was fermented at the stated address, or “Vinted,” which means
that the wine was subjected to cellar treatment at the stated address.</p>

<!--<wine-label-part id="country" part="COUNTRY OF ORIGIN" ul="36,375" size="251,13">-->
<H1>COUNTRY OF ORIGIN</H1>
<p>Pursuant to regulations issued by U.S. Customs and Border
Protection, a Country of Origin statement is required on containers of
imported wines. Acceptable statements include “Product of (insert
name of country)” or “Produced in (insert name of country).”</p>

</wine-label-part>

<wine-label-part id="contents" part="NET CONTENTS" ul="243,399" size="38,12">

measure. Wine must be bottled in 50 ml, 100 ml, 187 ml, 375 ml,
